## Multiple Hypothesis Tracking

**This repository is forked from [yoon28/pymht](https://github.com/mollyzyy787/pymht)**

This is an implementation of the Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) algorithm [1, 2, 3].
Check the `main.py`, the demonstration of MHT using counterfeit detections will be shown.

Notes:
- in `main.py`, on `canvas`, fp (false alarms) are drawn in red boxes and tp (true positives) are drawn in blue boxes. `obstacle` is an off-white rectangle fixed in position. There are by default 3 true targets that moves slowly and 1 dynamic true targets that circles around the field. The true target patches are generated by random noise with a different `mu`.
- tracking steps:
  - updateTrackTrees (0.1-0.2s)
  - makeConflictList (<1ms)
  - clustering (<1ms)
  - compBestHypoSet (4ms)
  - treePruning (<1ms)
  - branchMerging (<1ms)
