## Multiple Hypothesis Tracking

**This repository is forked from [yoon28/pymht](https://github.com/yoon28/pymht)**

This is an implementation of the Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) algorithm [1, 2, 3].
Check the `main.py`, the demonstration of MHT using counterfeit detections will be shown.

Notes:
- in `main.py`, on `canvas`, fp (false alarms) are drawn in red boxes and tp (true positives) are drawn in blue boxes. `obstacle` is an off-white rectangle fixed in position. There are by default 3 true targets that moves slowly and 1 dynamic true targets that circles around the field. The true target patches are generated by random noise with a different `mu`.
- tracking steps:
  - updateTrackTrees (0.1-0.2s)
    - for each track tree, propogate each leaf node with kalman filter, then update with each of the observations within gating. Then add new trees to the hypothesis set with each detections. The track_id is only incremented when a new node is added to a tree and that node is not a dummy node (i.e., it corresponds to a real object detection in the image).
  - makeConflictList (<1ms)
    - `conflictList[tree_id][leaf_id]` is a set of conflicting `(tree_id, node_id, track_id)`
  - clustering (<1ms)
    - put conflicting tree tracks in clusters
  - compBestHypoSet (4ms)
    - get a `best_set` for each cluster
  - treePruning (<1ms)
  - branchMerging (<1ms)
